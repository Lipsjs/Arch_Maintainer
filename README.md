# Arch Maintainer Tool

**Arch Maintainer Tool by Lipsjs** is a lightweight Bash script for Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions.  

It automates basic system maintenance:

- Updates system packages  
- Cleans old cached packages  
- Checks for failed systemd services  

The script is safe and bare-bones. If a package conflict occurs, it will skip the conflicting package and continue updating the rest of the system. Users are warned of any conflicts for manual resolution.
